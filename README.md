# sql_company_database
This is sql database schema for a company that includes complex database structure and design. 
It is made using popsql for writting the queries. And the schema contains primary and foreign key and composite keys as well. The relation between this key can be clearly seen in the schema image. 
Triggers are also used and while declaring the Triggers the Delimiter was changed to $$ using terminal and after than again changed to semi-colon. 
A lot of complex queries are also tested on this schema to get different kind of information and JOINS, UNION, SUM, AVG, GROUP BY are also used in queries to get different kind of data.
